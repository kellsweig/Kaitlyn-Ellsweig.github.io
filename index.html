					</h3>
					<p>
						I worked with The Friends of the Cobbossee Watershed, an
						environmental nonprofit working to protect the region's waterbodies
						from pollution and the threat of invasive species. I first used
						machine learning to develop a Gradient Boost model to predict the
						number of Courtesy Boat Inspections the organization would conduct
						in different scenarios. I then created multiple scenarios and
						deployed the model on those scenarios to create labor and budget
						projections. Using these projections and other analysis, I drafted
						recommendations for changes to budget and staffing for 2024.

					<p>
						In this project I developed a classfication model that was able to
						determine with 99.6% accuracy which of two related subreddits a post
						came from. First, I used the Reddit API, PRAW, to collect reddit
						posts from the subreddits r/ultralight and r/camping. I used a
						TF-IDF vectorizer for NLP and then trained a Random Forest,
						Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier and Voting Classifier to achieve my
						final model.

					<p>
						As the project manager of a group within a Data 
						Science Immersive Program, I led a comprehensive data science 
						project focused on understanding outcomes of the Covid-19 pandemic 
						and formulating a resiliency plan for future pandemics. My team 
						conducted an extensive analysis utilizing a combination of machine learning
						and other data analysis techniques. 
						We explored a myriad of variables, from policy considerations to demographics, 
						aiming to improve Covid-19 response strategies and devise a robust resiliency plan. 
						Leading the team through various stages, from data collection and cleaning to model 
						development and interpretation, I ensured effective collaboration and cohesive 
						progress. The diverse set of models, including white-box linear regressions and 
						black-box models such as Extra Trees and Random Forests, provided nuanced 
						insights into the factors influencing Covid-19 outcomes at both state and county levels. 
						This project not only showcased my leadership skills but also demonstrated a keen 
						understanding of the intricate relationships within public health data, contributing 
						valuable insights for future pandemic preparedness.

					<p>
						In this project, I was assigned to develop a predictive model for housing prices in 
						Ames, IA and was limited in model selection to OLS. Employing multiple linear 
						regression models, I explored various features such as house 
						type, square footage, and quality of materials. Through extensive exploratory 
						data analysis, model development, and refinement, I successfully achieved a 
						high-performing model with an R-squared value of 0.905 for validation data. 
						I utilized techniques such as feature engineering and regularization to enhance 
						model accuracy. This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis, model 
						development, and strategic decision-making, providing actionable insights for 
						real-world scenarios in the realm of construction and real estate.
