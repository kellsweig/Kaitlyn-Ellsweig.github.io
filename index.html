						Combining machine learning and data analysis to provide insights to

					</h3>
					<p>
						I worked with The Friends of the Cobbossee Watershed, an
						environmental nonprofit working to protect the region's waterbodies
						from pollution and the threat of invasive species. I first used
						machine learning to develop a Gradient Boost model to predict the
						number of Courtesy Boat Inspections the organization would conduct
						in different scenarios. I then created multiple scenarios and
						deployed the model on those scenarios to create labor and budget
						projections. Using these projections and other analysis, I drafted
						recommendations for changes to budget and staffing for 2024.

						In this project I developed a classfication model that was able to
						determine with 99.6% accuracy which of two related subreddits a post
						came from. First, I used the Reddit API, PRAW, to collect reddit
						posts from the subreddits r/ultralight and r/camping. I used a
						TF-IDF vectorizer for NLP and then trained a Random Forest,
						Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier and Voting Classifier to achieve my
						final model.

					<p>
						As the project manager of a group within a Data Science Immersive
						Program, I led a comprehensive data science project focused on
						understanding outcomes of the Covid-19 pandemic and formulating a
						resiliency plan for future pandemics. My team conducted an extensive
						analysis utilizing a combination of machine learning and other data
						analysis techniques. We explored a myriad of variables, from policy
						considerations to demographics, aiming to improve Covid-19 response
						strategies and devise a robust resiliency plan. Leading the team
						through various stages, from data collection and cleaning to model
						development and interpretation, I ensured effective collaboration
						and cohesive progress. The diverse set of models, including
						white-box linear regressions and black-box models such as Extra
						Trees and Random Forests, provided nuanced insights into the factors
						influencing Covid-19 outcomes at both state and county levels. This
						project not only showcased my leadership skills but also
						demonstrated a keen understanding of the intricate relationships
						within public health data, contributing valuable insights for future
						pandemic preparedness.

					<h2 class="major">Predicting Housing Prices in Ames Iowa</h2>
					<p>
						In this project, I was assigned to develop a predictive model for
						housing prices in Ames, IA and was limited in model selection to
						OLS. Employing multiple linear regression models, I explored various
						features such as house type, square footage, and quality of
						materials. Through extensive exploratory data analysis, model
						development, and refinement, I successfully achieved a
						high-performing model with an R-squared value of 0.905 for
						validation data. I utilized techniques such as feature engineering
						and regularization to enhance model accuracy. This project showcases
						my proficiency in data analysis, model development, and strategic
						decision-making, providing actionable insights for real-world
						scenarios in the realm of construction and real estate.
